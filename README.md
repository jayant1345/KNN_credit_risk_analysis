# KNN_credit_risk_analysis

# Project Description:

In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Age, Total Work Experience, number of years in city, cost to request ratio etc. and using that to classify loan applicantâ€™s Risk segmentation. 
However, before you go ahead with the project it is advised that you first preprocess the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise. 
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions. 

# Part-1: Data Exploration and Pre-processing

1) load the given dataset 
2) Check for the null values 
3) Get basic information from data 
4) Describe the dataset 
5) Display scatterplot between age & Total work Experience 
6) Display box plot for age 
7) Display box plot for Cibil score 
8) Create target and features data where target is Total bounces past 12 months

# Part-2: Working with Model 

1) Split data into training and testing sets 
2) Create a KNN classifier between Features and target data
3) Display the test score 
4) Display the training score 
5) Print the accuracy score 
6) Try 1 to 14 k values for classifier 
7) Display training and testing score for all the 1 to 14 k values
